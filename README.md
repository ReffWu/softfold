# Hinge

Give your MacBook desktop a little bend. Close the lid and watch your screen softly fold and blur. Open it and everything comes back.

## For the nerds

Hinge reads the lid angle as often as the sensor updates it, in hundredths of a degree where your Mac reports them, and turns it into a continuous animation. Slow tilt, slow bend. Quick tilt, quick bend. A little smoothing fills in between readings.

ScreenCaptureKit supplies your live desktop, and Metal adds perspective and progressive blur at 60 fps. Capture only runs while the lid is closing or folded and stops a few seconds after it opens again. Everything stays in memory on your Mac. No recordings, no uploads.

## Install

Requires an Apple silicon MacBook with a supported lid sensor and macOS 14 or later. Not every MacBook has one; Hinge tells you if yours doesn't.

[Download Hinge](https://hinge.noveum.ai/download), open the DMG, and drag Hinge into Applications. This prototype is not notarized; macOS may ask you to approve it under Privacy & Security.

Prefer building it yourself? Grab Xcode, then:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Noveum/hinge.git
cd hinge
make build
open build/Hinge.app
```

Allow Screen Recording, reopen Hinge if prompted, and turn it on. It turns itself back on the next time you open it. The starting angle is 100°. Prefer something else? Get comfy and click **Set open position**. Hinge remembers.

Hinge speaks your Mac's language: English, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, Turkish, Polish, Arabic and Vietnamese. To use a different one, pick it under **Settings > Controls > Language**.
